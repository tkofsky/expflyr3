A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office action.  Discussion of provisional full refusal.  This is a provisional full refusal of the request for extension of protection to the United States of the international registration, known in the United States as a U.S. application based on Trademark Act Section 66(a).  See 15 U.S.C. §§1141f(a), 1141h(c).  The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03. Likelihood of ConfusionRegistration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in U.S. Registration No.5375041 . Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.   The stated refusal refers to International Classes 35and 42 only and does not bar registration in the other classes. Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source of the services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the relatedness of the compared  services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b). Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b). In this case, both marks contain the term "KREA." It is this portion of the mark tht consumers are most likely to recall when encountering the mark used in connection with the services.    The r services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi). In this case, applicant's services include "brand creation and brand management for goods, services, businesses" and "building design services; technical infrastructure design services."Registrant's services are "[b]rand concept and brand development services for corporate and individual clients " and "Architectural design; Graphic design; Web site design ."  The services are closely related, namely, they both include brand creation and design services.  Given the similarity of the marks and the closely related nature of the services, consumers are likely to be confused as to the source of the services.  Consequently, registration is refused under Section 2(d). Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below. Identification of ServicesThe current wording used to describe the services needs clarification because it is currently indefinite and too broad.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  For instance, in Class 35, the wording “retail sale” in the identification of services in International Class 35 is indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.11.  To be a registrable service, the activity must be primarily for the benefit of someone other than the applicant.  See In re Reichhold Chems., Inc., 167 USPQ 376, 377 (TTAB 1970).  “Sales” or “selling” normally refers to selling one’s own goods or services and is not a registrable service rendered for the benefit of others.  See TMEP §§1301.01(a)(ii), 1402.11. Therefore, applicant must delete “sale” from the identification and indicate with greater specificity the nature of the service in International Class 35; e.g., “retail store services featuring a wide variety of consumer goods of others featured in media.” Also in Class 35, the wording “reproduction of documents” is indefinite and too broad.  This wording must be clarified because it is not clear what the services are and could identify services in more than one international class.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03, 1904.02(c), (c)(ii).  For example, document reproduction in the nature of digitization of documents is in International Class 42 and document reproduction in the nature of photocopying services are in International Class 35. In an application filed under Trademark Act Section 66(a), an applicant may not change the classification of services from that assigned by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization in the corresponding international registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.85(d); TMEP §§1401.03(d), 1904.02(b).  Therefore, although the services may be classified in several international classes, any modification to this wording must identify services in International Class 35 only, the class specified in the application for these services.  See TMEP §1904.02(c), (c)(ii). Additionally, applicant is advised to delete or modify the duplicate entries in the identification of services in International Class 35 for “publication of advertising texts” and International Class 36 for “rental and lease of real estate”.  See generally TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.01(a).  If applicant does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO will remove duplicate entries from the identification prior to registration. If modifying one of the duplicate entries, applicant may amend it to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden or expand the services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Also, generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e). In Class 41, the identification for educational services is indefinite because it does not indicate the type of educational service provided.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  For example, applicant could be providing seminars on a particular topic, analyzing educational test scores and data for others, or providing educational testing.  Applicant must specify the nature of the educational service being provided.  If applicant is providing classes or similar group learning activities, the identification must specify (1) the form of the activity (e.g., classes, seminars, workshops) and (2) the subject matter or field (e.g., retirement benefits, nutrition, business management).  Also in Class 41, the identification of services contains parentheses.  Generally, applicants should not use parentheses and brackets in identifications in their applications so as to avoid confusion with the USPTO’s practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate services that have been deleted from registrations or in an affidavit of incontestability to indicate services not claimed.  See TMEP §1402.12.  The only exception is that parenthetical information is permitted in identifications in an application if it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).”  Id. Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses from the identification and incorporate any parenthetical information into the description of the services. All unacceptable wording is discussed, by class, below.  Bolded wording indicates suggested additions to clarify indefinite/overbroad wording.  Bolded italicized wording indicates fill-in-the blank elements with suggestions.  Bolded strikethrough (example) indicates suggested deletions.  Bolded wording within brackets indicates explanatory notes not to be reproduced in applicant’s amended identification. Applicant may adopt the following identification of services, if accurate:  Class 35:         {confirm Class 35 nature of consulting, e.g., Business} consulting services in the field of management, organization and conduct of financial business;
